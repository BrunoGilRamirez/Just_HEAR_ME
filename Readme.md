# SÃ³lo EscÃºchame: Spanish Emotional Accompaniment Chatbot ðŸ’¬ðŸ¤–

Welcome to **SÃ³lo EscÃºchame** â€“ an open-source Spanish emotional assistance chatbot powered by the LLaMA-2-7b-Chat model. Our goal is to provide emotional support through advanced AI. ðŸ’¡

## Models in HuggingFace ðŸ¤—

**SÃ³lo EscÃºchame** is an enhanced, fine-tuned model based on LLaMA-2-7b-Chat, meticulously trained using the datasets outlined in the next section. You can download the model and find detailed specifications by clicking [here](https://huggingface.co/BrunoGR/Just_HEAR_Me).

Additionally, we offer another version of this model, also fine-tuned on LLaMA-2-7b-Chat, utilizing the PEFT Adapter. This version is optimized for broader accessibility, requiring fewer computational resources.

### Datasets ðŸ“š

At the core of our work lies the data. We have introduced two essential datasets:

> - [**Hispanic Emotion Recognition Based on Plutchikâ€™s Wheel (HRECPW)**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrunoGR/HRECPW-Hispanic_Responses_for_Emotional_Classification_based_on_Plutchik_Wheel) -  is designed for training models in the task of emotional classification. This dataset allows models to identify and classify various emotional categories based on the Plutchik wheel, with a particular focus on the Spanish language. 


> - [**HEAR (Hispanic Emotional Accompaniment Responses)**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrunoGR/HEAR-Hispanic_Emotional_Accompaniment_Responses) - is designed to train language models in the task of emotionally accompanying users. This dataset enables models to generate empathetic and appropriate responses in Spanish, understanding and responding to different emotional situations.

### Research Paper ðŸ“–

Our paper has been accepted in the at the **23rd Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence** ([MICAI 2024](http://www.micai.org/2024/)). You can also find our work on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/).
